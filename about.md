Philomath and an avid reader of technical books with interests in Software Defined Networks(SDN) and Machine Learning(ML). I am more interested in the networks domain and exploring the domain of Software based networks.

I completed my B.Tech from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal (NITK) with majors in Computer Science and Engineering. While I have carried out several projects in different domains during my academic years, I have my academic interests primarily in SDN and Applications of ML.

Apart from the academics, I spend my leisure time exploring following areas:
+ International and current affairs
+ Calligraphy
+ History and Culture
+ Blogging

Feel free to contact me in case you need any help related to content on this blog or any other projects I have carried out. I am also open to feedback, so send me an email if you want me to add or improve any content related to my interests.
